    <h3 class="Author">Daniel Tammett</h3>
    <p class="mathQuote">Even the greatest mathematicians, the ones that we would put into our mythology of great mathematicians, had to do a great deal of leg work in order to get to the solution in the end.</p>

    <h4 class="philosophyWork">Moral Letters to Lucilius</h4>
    <p class="philosophyQuote">1. I have been asking about you, and inquiring of everyone who comes from your part of the country, what you are doing, and where you are spending your time, and with whom. You cannot deceive me; for I am with you. Live just as if I were sure to get news of your doings, nay, as if I were sure to behold them. And if you wonder what particularly pleases me that I hear concerning you, it is that I hear nothing, that most of those whom I ask do not know what you are doing.</p>
    <p class="philosophyQuote">2. This is sound practice - to refrain from associating with men of different stamp and different aims. And I am indeed confident that you cannot be warped, that you will stick to your purpose, even though the crowd may surround and seek to distract you. What, then, is on my mind? I am not afraid lest they work a change in you; but I am afraid lest they may hinder your progress. And much harm is done even by one who hold you backs, especially since life is so short; and we make it still shorter by our unsteadiness, by making every fresh beginnings at life, now one and immediately another. We break up life into little bits, and fritter it away. </p>
    <p class="philosophyQuote">3. Hasten ahead, then, dearest Lucilius, and reflect how greatly you would quicken your speed if an enemy were at your back, or if you suspected the cavalry were approaching and pressing hard upon your steps as you fled. It is true; the enemy is indeed pressing upon you; you should therefore increase your speed and escape away and reach a safe position, remembering continually what a noble thing it is to round out your life before death comes, and then await in peace the remaining portion of your time, claiming nothing for yourself, since you are in possession of the happy life; for such a life is not made happier for being longer.</p>
    <p class="philosophyQuote">4. O when shall you see the time when you shall know that time means nothing to you, when you shall be peaceful and calm, careless of the morrow, because you are enjoying your life to the full? Would you know what makes men greedy for the future? It is because no one has yet found himself. Your parents, to be sure, asked other blessings for you; but I myself pray rather that yo may despise all those things which your parents wished for you in abundance. Their prayers plunder many another person, simply that you may be enriched. Whatever they make over to you must be removed from someone else. </p>
    <p class="philosophyQuote">5. I pray that you may get such control over yourself that your mind, now shaken by wandering thoughts, may at last come to rest and be steadfast, that it may be content with itself and, having attained an understanding of what things are truly good, - and they are in our possession as soon as we have this knowledge, - that it may have no need of added years. He has at length passed beyond all necessities - he has won his honorable discharge and is free, - who still lives after his life and has been completed. </p>
    <h2 class="Categories" id="programming">Programming:</h2>
    <h3 class="Author">Robin Milner</h3>
    <p class="programmingQuote">There are many ways of trying to understand programs. People often rely too much on one way, which is called “debugging” and consists of running a partly-understood program to see if it does what you expected. Another way, which ML advocates, is to install some means of understanding in the very programs themselves.</p>
    <h2 class="Categories" id="aphorisms">Aphorisms:</h2>
    <h3 class="Author">Piet Hein</h3> 
    <p class ="aphorismsQuote"> “Problems worthy of attack
      prove their worth by fighting back.” </p>
    <h3 class="Author">Mortimer Adler</h3>
    <p class="aphorismsQuote">The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.</p>
    <p class="aphorismsQuote">To regard anyone except yourself as responsible for your judgement is to be a slave, not a free man.</p>
    <h3 class="Author">Ali Abdaal</h3>
    <p class="aphorismsQuote">If you want to increase your happiness by spending money, then the only way to do that really is by removing salient negatives, rather than by adding additional positives.</p>
    <h3 class="Author">James Clear</h3>
    <p class="aphorismsQuote">Every action you take is essential a vote for your identity. So when you fixate on your identity, it actually influences the actions you take. It's kind of a two-way street.</p>
